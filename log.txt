sidebar contains:
- username
- notes
- photos
- blogs

TODO: sidebar has a fixed top (users and stuff) and bottom (storage used)
    TODO: don't use flex, instead use position: fixed (following what chatgpt.com does) and add the necessary offsets to the top and bottom using css variables.
TODO: ?render=sidebar will render the page and return only the item with the matching id (using server-side html parsing)
TODO: dig into the dropdown menu and figure out how to make a tap outside any floating UI to only dismiss the floating UI and not everything e.g. if the open sidebar shows a dropdown menu, clicking outside the dropdown menu should only dismiss the dropdown menu and not also hide the open sidebar.

folder? or folders?
should folders and notes be kepts in separate tables?
if separate, we can pull folders and notes separately (i.e. folders first, then notes). But then how do we paginate with say limit 100? Does the limit 100 apply to folders or notes? both? combined limit? combined limit is not possible if we pull folders and notes separately
or do we have a UI that can display both folders and notes separately in a seamless pattern? but every desktop file explorer UI so far displays them together (with option to separate). how?
what if we just displayed _all_ folders unconditionally?

notes have names? no, folders have names. should folder names be included in the full text search? yes
how should search be organized? search note text. notes can contain photos and videos. photos contain OCR-ed text that may be searched.
