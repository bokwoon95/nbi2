TODO: add the table into a card on large, but remove the card on mobile
TODO: add pagination to below and above the table
TODO: file explorer columns: $title $preview $creationDate (edited $editedDate) $size
TODO: a button to preview a note inline? hmmm
TODO: /cms/notes/ with various dummy notes put in place. We are only using list view a la Apple Notes.
    TODO: How big to make the navbar? What buttons to put in it? Create Note
    TODO: double... sidebars?
        TODO: remember, the directory view has to be able to paginate somewhere. How?

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- filesystem-based (nested folders)
- million-file pagination
- folders-first sorting, but the ability to toggle the behavior
- no CRDT, plain old save button
- URL-addressable UI
- if possible, double sidebar UI for notes

- simple UI, more Apple than Evernote
- we can exclude the typical double-sidebar view if we focus on packing as many notes as we can into the directory view. the directory view is essentially read-only, which simplifies many user interactions as compared to combining directory view and note view (both read and write)
- do... nested folders really take up less space than a note in folder view though? actually no, directories can show nested stats like file count while notes will show like a single line of preview. it's fine. this means directories need t
- show directories separately or together with files? together, having a UI to paginate directories and notes separately will be a pain in the ass. If the user doesn't want to obscure their folders with notes, organize better. If a user doesn't want to jump through so many nested steps, simply pin the relevant directory to the sidebar.
- Fine, we'll do a save button (syncs better with desktop workflows)
    - But we'll need to tackle the common pitfalls of having to save manually

navbar buttons
- directory: toggleSidebar, create (createDirectory, createNote), ellipsis (pin, search, sort)
- note: toggleSidebar, save

folder? or folders?
should folders and notes be kepts in separate tables?
if separate, we can pull folders and notes separately (i.e. folders first, then notes). But then how do we paginate with say limit 100? Does the limit 100 apply to folders or notes? both? combined limit? combined limit is not possible if we pull folders and notes separately
or do we have a UI that can display both folders and notes separately in a seamless pattern? but every desktop file explorer UI so far displays them together (with option to separate). how?
what if we just displayed _all_ folders unconditionally?

notes have names? no, folders have names. should folder names be included in the full text search? yes
how should search be organized? search note text. notes can contain photos and videos. photos contain OCR-ed text that may be searched.
