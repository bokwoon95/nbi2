side-pane, not-side-pane

- username
- notes
- photos
- blogs

/cms/createnote/
/cms/notes/:noteID
/cms/photos/:photoID
/cms/sites/bokwoon/
/cms/sites/bokwoon.com/

TODO: every accordion in the side pane has a unique name associated with it. When the user toggles an accordion, JavaScript persists the state of all accordions into a cookie. The server reads the cookie on each requests and renders the each accordion in an initially open or initially closed state accordingly.
TODO: figure out why clicking on outside the sidebar-pane in mobile mode doesn't hide the sidebar

TODO: object_storage.go: implement GetRange for ObjectStorage.

TODO: Make Notes and Photos into an accordion so that it can dropdown into the full list of pinned items. And it should also function as a link. Only clicking on the chevron (padded) will reveal the full list of items.
