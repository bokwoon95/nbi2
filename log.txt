/cms/photos/:photoID
/cms/albums/:albumID

folder? or folders?
should folders and notes be kepts in separate tables?
if separate, we can pull folders and notes separately (i.e. folders first, then notes). But then how do we paginate with say limit 100? Does the limit 100 apply to folders or notes? both? combined limit? combined limit is not possible if we pull folders and notes separately
or do we have a UI that can display both folders and notes separately in a seamless pattern? but every desktop file explorer UI so far displays them together (with option to separate). how?
what if we just displayed _all_ folders unconditionally?

notes have names? no, folders have names. should folder names be included in the full text search? yes
how should search be organized? search note text. notes can contain photos and videos. photos contain OCR-ed text that may be searched.

TODO: every accordion in the side pane has a unique name associated with it. When the user toggles an accordion, JavaScript persists the state of all accordions into a cookie. The server reads the cookie on each requests and renders the each accordion in an initially open or initially closed state accordingly.

TODO: Make Notes and Photos into an accordion so that it can dropdown into the full list of pinned items. And it should also function as a link. Only clicking on the chevron (padded) will reveal the full list of items.

documents is a markdown document with associated imgs/videos
what about bookmarks? what is the best format for saving snippets from the web/various social media apps?
photos is files
