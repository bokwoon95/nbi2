## Coding style
- DO NOT create single use functions which merely serve as descriptive containers of code. DO inline the code as much as possible and sprinkle comments if too cryptic. NO utility functions!
- DO NOT create intermediate variables which merely serve as descriptive containers of a value. DO inline literals and expressions as much as possible and sprinkle comments if too cryptic. NO useless variables!
- DO use the minimum number of HTML elements where possible. No div soup, strive for simplicity.
- HTML, CSS and JS use two space indentation.
- When achieving effects by CSS, use the bare minimum rules (i.e. no rules to make it look pretty) unless otherwise specified.
- For every CSS rule added, justify why it exists with a comment otherwise remove it. Use the bare minimum CSS rules!
